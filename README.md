# DATA-824-Final-Project
Shiny App for Data 824 Final

This Shiny App displays Sepal and Petal dimensions for Iris flowers as well as plotting where various Iris species fall among those dimensions. The user can change the x and y variables to display Sepal length, Sepal width, Petal length, and Petal width through a drop down box. The number of species showing can also be manipulated by the user by the numeric box and utilizing the up and down arrow keys on the right hand side of the box. Each species being displayed is represented by a color to make them easy to differentiate between each other.
